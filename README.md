# hla_mismatch_calculator_html_version

A LITTLE HISTORY:
This is a small program to calculate HLA antigen mismatches between blood and marrow transplant donors and recipients.
I wrote this program to automate the manual task of doing this for my current job. As such, it runs locally as it was for personal use.

HOW IT'S MADE:
HTML, CSS, Javascript

INSTRUCTIONS:
Open the index.html file in your browser. Enter in the HLA antigens as directed to calculate the number of mismatches.

LESSONS LEARNED:
I tried to implement as much of a functional programming style as I could. My goal was to make this project as modular as possible so that, in the future, I could add the ability to analyze multiple gene loci at once; currently, the program only analyzes one gene locus at a time. For my job, we usually have to analzye six gene loci for mismatches/matches.

AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT:
There is a lot of repetition in the code; in future iterations, I would like to reduce the repetition.
